			<p class="main" align="center"> Our club has been running for almost 40 years! What sets us apart from other dog training groups is that we like to make our members feel involved with the club. We also want to play a bigger part within the community and so we regularly fund raise for various dog charities. Our instructors are very experienced and will be there to help and advise whenever needed. When you join us, you will be asked to fill in a Registration Form and will be given a copy of the clubs constitution and rules. You will receive information leaflets that are updated on a regular basis. You will be asked to provide proof of your dogs up to date vaccinations. We have brought together a great committee of indiciduals who really care about the club and our dogs!</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Beginner Class Trainer:</strong><br><br></p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been attending Silverthorn Dog Training Club since 2011 have been through all four of the classes with my dog as a member.
				I am new to the club as an instructor but my many years of training classes and working with my and other dogs in the classes has given me a good knowledge of how to get the best from dogs.
				Being firm but fair, clear and concise commands to the dog combined with patience and reward based training works.
				The dogs just want clear leadership with love and care thrown in. We aim to help the dog owners to be that leader.
